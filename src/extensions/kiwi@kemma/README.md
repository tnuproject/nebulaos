## Features

- **Under the hood restyling**: very minimal Gnome shell and GTK/Adwaita app restyling keeping maximum look and compatibility. Reduced menu item spacing; menu item accent colors; uniform top panel status icon padding and more...
- **Window Control Button Style**: Set macOS window control button styles and sizes.
- **Firefox and Thunderbird Styling**: Apply macOS window control styling for Firefox.
- **Show Window Controls in Panel**: Move buttons to top panel for maximized windows and remove window titlebars for maximum space.
- **Show Window title**: Display current window title in the top panel
- **Show Panel on Hover**: Show panel when mouse is near top edge in fullscreen. Bugged for GTK4 apps.
- **Move Window to New Workspace**: Automatically move fullscreen app to new workspace.
- **Set Panel Transparnecy**: Make the top panel transparent or opaque when window touches it
- **Transparent Move**: Make windows slightly transparent when moving.
- **Battery Percentage**: Show battery percentage in the system menu when below 20% and on battery.
- **Move calendar to the right**: Move calendar to right side and hide and add notifications and media controls to Quick Settings.
- **Overview Wallpaper Background blur**: Use blurred current wallpaper as overview background.
- **Focus on Overview Exit**: Focus the window under the cursor instead of the previously focused one when leaving the overview, like macOS Mission Control.
- **Panel and Dash-to-Dock dynamic blur**: Add dynamic blur to top panel or Dash-to-Dock.
- **Adaptive Dock Colors**: Flip the Dash-to-Dock running indicators and separators between light and dark to suit whatever is behind the dock — a window passing under it as much as the wallpaper.
- **Minimize Windows to Dock**: Park minimized windows as thumbnails in Dash-to-Dock, after the apps and before the trash, macOS style. Minimize and restore animations run to and from the thumbnail.
- **Downloads Folder in Dock**: Add a Downloads folder before the trash that fans its newest files out over the desktop, macOS stack style. Click a file to open it, or the last row to open the folder. Optionally the files stick out of the folder icon instead of piling on top of it.
- **Multilingual UI**: Fully translatable interface and is easy to extend via `po/` files.

- **Skip Overview on Login**: Do not show the overview when logging into GNOME; go directly to the desktop.
- **Launchpad Applications**: Add custom launch applications icon to the dock. Move it freely to any place.
- **Style Keyboard Indicator**. Style keyboard/input source indicator in panel by converting to uppercase and adding border. Also can hide it.
- **Focus Launched Window**: Focus on newly launched windows. Removes the annoying window-ready notification.

## Known Issues

- in multimonitor setup sometimes max number of workspaces are created. See issue #49.
- *move to fullscreen* can behave unexpectedly due to built in GNOME dynamic workspace management. Disabling it might help.
- Advanced triple button hover effect will not work for GTK3 flatpak apps due to sandboxing
- Electron apps now by default have wayland enabled which causes to use CSD and thus many title bar issues, like blurry icons or completely different window control icons. There is no CSS fix beyond avoiding forced Wayland or passing `--ozone-platform=x11` argument to force `Xwayland` usage.
- similarly to electron apps also KDE apps by default uses CSD on wayland causing the same issues. To force `Xwayland` usage for KDE apps have to pass environmental variable `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb`.

Run this command to override `xdg-config` and theme window control buttons for Flatpak apps:

```sh
flatpak override --user --filesystem=xdg-config/gtk-3.0:ro
flatpak override --user --filesystem=xdg-config/gtk-4.0:ro
flatpak override --user --filesystem=xdg-config/environment.d/:ro
flatpak override --user --filesystem=$HOME/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/kiwi@kemma/:ro
